## Features

### Terrain Conversion
- Convert Unity terrains to optimized mesh chunks with texture splatmaps
- LOD level generation with customizable transition heights and reduction strength
- Configurable chunk size and resolution
- Mesh collider and static flag options
- Flexible terrain handling (disable, hide, or keep enabled)

### Shader Options
- Multiple shader variants:
  - Unlit shader for maximum performance
  - Lit shader for Built-in Render Pipeline (BIRP)
  - Lit shader for Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- Normal map support for enhanced visual detail
- Support for up to 4 terrain textures using Texture Arrays
- Optional lightmap and smoothness effects
- Distance-based texture resampling
- Height-based texture blending
- Customizable texture tiling

### Vegetation Export
- Tree conversion with full hierarchy preservation
- Detail object export supporting both:
  - Texture-based grass/details
  - Prefab-based vegetation
- Density control and placement optimization
- LOD support for tree prefabs
- Customizable detail spawn settings

### Mesh Adjustment Tool
- Fix floating or sunken objects after terrain conversion
- Bulk adjustment of vegetation and props to terrain height
- Surface normal alignment options
- Configurable sink depth
- Debug visualization mode
- Fast processing mode for large object sets
